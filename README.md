This paper designs and builds a predictive model of the selling prices of used cars by using tabular data. The data is prepared with the application of feature engineering and preprocessing methods, and models are trained using Linear Regression and Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT). The GBT model has an R^2 of 0.9617, RMSE of 1888.48, which shows that it predicts well. This has been shown by the results since ensemble approaches are very effective in obtaining complicated feature relationships. The results indicate that predictive analytics has a chance of securing fair pricing and improving buyer and seller decision-making, as well as the idea of transparency in the automotive market.
